    "## ✅ Modern LangChain Memory with RunnableWithMessageHistory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the **officially supported** LangChain memory approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ **Old (Deprecated)**: `ConversationBufferMemory` \n",
    "- ✅ **New (Official)**: `RunnableWithMessageHistory` with `InMemoryChatMessageHistory`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits:\n",
    "- 🚀 **No deprecation warnings** - Officially supported, future-proof\n",
    "- 🎯 **Much simpler code** - ~20 lines vs 100+ lines for manual approach\n",
    "- 💾 **Automatic persistence** - Built-in conversation memory management\n",
    "- 👥 **Multi-session support** - Separate conversations by session ID\n",
    "- 🔧 **Tool compatibility** - Works seamlessly with agent tools\n",
    "- 📝 **Flexible backends** - Can switch to Redis, SQLite, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "1. `InMemoryChatMessageHistory` automatically stores conversation messages\n",
    "2. `RunnableWithMessageHistory` wraps the agent with memory management\n",
    "3. Each session gets its own isolated conversation history\n",
    "4. Memory is managed transparently - no manual message tracking needed!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session Management:\n",
    "- Default session: `chat(\"Hello!\")` \n",
    "- Named sessions: `chat(\"Hello!\", session_id=\"user123\")`\n",
    "- Multiple conversations run independently"
