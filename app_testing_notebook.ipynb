      "=== SENDING RESPONSE: It sounds like you might be referring to an action or a command that was just executed—perhaps something like clearing a cache, resetting a form, or refreshing data. When you ask \"did that only clear the front end?\", you're wondering whether the operation affected just what you see in your browser or app (the user interface), or if it also changed the underlying data on the server or database (the back end).\n",

      "For me to give you a specific answer, could you clarify what action you just took? For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Did you clear a cache, reset a form, delete an item, or log out?\n",
      "- Which application or system are you working with?\n",
      "- What was supposed to be cleared: data visible to you, or data stored on a server?\n",
      "\n",
      "In general:\n",
      "- \"Front end\" typically refers to changes only visible to you, and not affecting the stored data permanently.\n",
      "- \"Back end\" changes affect the database or server, meaning the change is persistent and applies to all users or future sessions.\n",
